TrayBot
==============

TrayBot&copy; is a friendly robot designed using a [TurtleBot](http://www.turtlebot.com/)
robot system in order to enhance your home lifestyle, and any scale of events from house 
parties to large symposiums. The software hosted here publicly, when configured to a 
TurtleBot using the robotics framework [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/), will transform the 
TurtleBot into a sophisticated TrayBot. A TrayBot can perform the following duties: 
* Navigate through a room while avoiding non-human obstacles in its path
* Detect people using leg-recognition software via the Kinect
* Approach people safely, and efficiently to serve them refreshments or whatever
you might like to serve.
* Tell pre-programmed jokes as it moves from guest to guest.
* Navigate back to a pre-defined refill station when it has run out of refreshments.

The TrayBot can be controlled via a web-app interface. The web interface shows a map of 
the area the TrayBot is using to navigate and serve guests. An operator could manually force 
the TrayBot to return to a refill station, or manually point out a location for the 
TrayBot to navigate to. The operator can even drive the TrayBot using the web controls too.
Some things we would like to add is support for multiple TrayBots in the same location, and
having configureable settings for the user to be able to define their own jokes and easily
redefine the TrayBot's internal map of the area its in.

## Autumn 2014 Robotics Capstone
This software was developed for a senior capstone course held at the 
University of Washington, Seattle. The course objective was to teach the basics 
of robotics and give students implementation experience with a state-of-the-art 
mobile robot using the robot programming framework ROS (Robot Operating System).
